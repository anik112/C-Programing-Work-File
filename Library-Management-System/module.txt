Since many of my classmates have a problem with the requirements of the project, I'll shortlist them here:

1. The deletion shouldn't physically remove the data from the file. It should just flag the record as unavailable, and this operation should make quantity 0.

2. After a book is deleted, it can't be edited/issued.

3. Search Book should have two option to search by. Book ID, or category/keyword.

4. Issusing a book to student should decrement the book quantity, and returning of a book should increment a book quantity.

5. If a book quantity is 0 but not deleted, even then the book can't be issued. However, new stock of books can be added to facilitate issuing of books.

6. Students should be given a unique ID to help them return the book as two or more students can have same name.

7. Book ID should be auto-generated, positive and unique integer. Book price must be positive. 

8. Issue and return date of issuing book should be valid dates.

9. Book and author name should only accept English letters
